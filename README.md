Assignment title - Assignment 2: QSAR Data Curation Using ChEMBL
Selected target name - p53
Number of bioactivity records - 29

Data curation workflow using ChEMBL
Bioactivity and compound data were programmatically retrieved from the ChEMBL database and curated using Python scripts developed in Google Colab. The workflow involved filtering assays with well-defined targets, standardizing activity types and units, removing duplicates and unreliable entries, and validating compound–target associations. The curated dataset was annotated with relevant metadata and molecular descriptors to enable robust downstream analysis and modeling.
